### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile 👋

###  About me ::

🧠 Hello! I am a web developer with future goals in data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am passionate about technology and am working to become an expert in these areas.

As a web developer, I have experience in web application development and related technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and popular frameworks like Angular and React. I have been involved in building and deploying high quality web applications with good interactive interface and good user experience.

However, I am learning and discovering more about data science and Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in applying machine learning algorithms and methods to analyze data, find useful information, and create predictive models. I wanted to explore the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence in creating intelligent applications and automating complex processes.

I am always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in exciting and groundbreaking projects. I believe that the combination of web programming, data science and Artificial Intelligence will help me contribute to building intelligent and optimized applications for the future.

If there are any questions or cooperation opportunities, please feel free to contact me. I am looking forward to contribute and grow in this field to bring value and progress to the community.
